				<h1>Projeto 1</h1>

				<p> Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
					I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
					She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
					In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
					Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
					Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
					Didn't make sense not to live for fun
					Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
					So much to do, so much to see
					So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
					You'll never know if you don't go
					You'll never shine if you don't glow  
				</p>
